As a young person I was driven.  I'm guessing that you are too, or you wouldn't have even bothered to read this.  There's a lot of things that I didn't know as a young person, and some of them would have made my life a lot easier.  That's why I started writing this - so that my nieces and nephews would have a reference for the things that they don't have to learn the hard way.

Poverty means a lot of different things to a lot of people, but if you think you are in poverty, and want to get out, then you can do it with education.  I don't want to confuse you though, education is not the easy route to get lots of money.  I don't know if there is any easy route out of poverty.  But I know there is a slow and reliable route by learning all the things.  I doubt you'll become a moneybags through education, as that isn't really the point.  People like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs and so forth had to have *some* education, but it wasn't education that made either of them rich.  It was their work ethic, a lot of luck, and taking risks that happened to pay off for them.

I'm not going to recommend risky options to you.  I might point some out as we identify them in discussing the long road.  At any point you might find that there's a risky shortcut you can take to get you out of poverty fast, and as you become more educated and build more contacts these will become more and more frequent occurrences.  You can take one of these routes any time you want!  But keep in mind when you do that it is easier to go from zero to hero that it is to go from negative a million dollars to a house and car.

Are you sure you even want to have money?  There are a lot of styles of life that don't really require much that you can be happy with.  Having a great and loving family, being an incredible artist, and living from couch to couch with your friends are all alternatives that may work better for your personality type. Some people even prefer to live on a sailboat!  Education is a slow path, and it isn't right for everyone.  Think about it.
