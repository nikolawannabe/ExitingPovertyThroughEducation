Sleep is for the Weak
==============================

> Society lied to us for years, by telling us that we could work our way up out of poverty with minimum wage jobs, but there is a way to your dreams that really does work, and it is paved with books and classes.  If you're a middle school kid stuck in a trailer park, but you want better, this book will explain how you can afford to get an education. 

Many, many kids in the United States think that they can never afford to go to college.  They waste their formative and free years cursing the system that put them into poverty, and wasting their healthy bodies and minds on worthless go-nowhere jobs that will never cover a decent mortgage, much less take care of a family, instead of working smart to get out of it.  When you are deep in poverty, you may not have a plan for how to get out, or even to where to start.

Society lied to you.  You can't work your way up from a minimum wage job as the wage and positional disparity between that job and the jobs that pay how much you need to live independently is just too high.  You need good advice from someone who has been there to learn how to work your way out of poverty.

Here's the truth:  You don't have to pay exorbitant amounts of cold, hard-saved cash to afford an education.  If you want to go to college it is most definitely possible, and in many cases you can do it at little cost to your or your parents.  That fast food job you're working to save up will never get you out of the trailer park, but you can still go to college.

If you're an adult, the free strategies for attending college that I describe aren't designed for you, but I also describe some other ways to afford college that may work for you.  You can educate yourself at any age, if you know how the system works and where to push the system to make it really work for you.

Once you get to college, your background will hurt you if you don't know how to unlearn all the bad habits you've learned.  The short-term thinking you learn while in poverty will affect how you deal with money, health care, and many other crucial skill areas that poverty trained you improperly to deal with.

It's worth it to get an education.  Getting a degree may not be the "easy in" that it once was, but not having a degree is almost always an "easy out" of the good jobs that you want!
